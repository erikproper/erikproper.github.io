  <h2>Camera systems</h2>
  <p>
    Over the years, I have used different video and photo camera systems, covering analog and digital, as well as <a href="links/full-frame">full-frame</a> and <a href="links/aps-c">APS-C</a> based systems, across different brands.
    On this page, I discuss the evolution of the systems I used, as well as the reason for moving to another system.
    Some of the initial moves between systems are tied to my <a href="./photography-history.html">troubled start</a> with photography, but the more recent ones are more related to the "pixel to weight" ratio of the involved camera systems.
  </p>
  
  <h3>The early analog years</h3>
  <p>
    I started out with a "hand-me-down" Agfa Isopan camera, which was later replaced by a Super 8 Film camera, which I believe was by Canon.
    Around 1989, when I got <a href="./photography-history.html">back</a> into photography  I started with a Ricoh compact camera.
    During my Australian years, around 1996, I complemented this with an (analog) Panasonic video camera, to be able to send videos of my "adventures" back home to my Family in the Netherlands.
  </p>
  
  <h3>From analog to digital</h3>
  <p>
    After returning to the Netherlands, I initially stayed with video.
    Around 1999, I started using a digital video camera (with tapes) by Canon.
    As an experiment, to see if I wanted to return to photography, I bought a Canon PowerShot A40.
    This was actually my first digital photo camera.
    As the photos I made with this camera turned out to be fairly good, my partner at the time suggested that I use her Minolta SLR system during some work related trips to Uganda, which also resulted in a <a href="highlights/0306">positive experience</a>.
  </p>
    
  <h3>Transitioning to the Canon DSLR system</h3>
  <p>
    The <a href="highlights/0306">positive experience</a> with both the Canon PowerShot A40 and the Minolta SLR system, inspired a transition to a Canon DSLR system.
    This is when, around 2004, I transitioned from the video camera to Canon's EF-S DSLR systems.
    First a 300D, which was later replaced by a 20D and 30D.
    Once I was certain that photography was "there to stay", around 2006, I moved from Canon's <a href="links/aps-c">APS-C</a> based EF-S system to their <a href="links/full-frame">full-frame</a> system.
    More specifically towards the 5D series, together with an upgrade of the lenses from EF-S to EF.
    The latter, eventually, also resulted in a rather heavy camera bag ... burdening the "pixel to weight" ratio ...
  </p>
  
  <h3>Transitioning to Sony's mirrorless system</h3>
  <p>
    Early 2012, I found myself taking less and less photos.
    This was partially due to a busy work agenda, but also be
    I had just moved to Luxembourg to take up a challenging new job. 
    At the same time I was also getting "fed-up" with the need to have to lug my heavy camera bag around. 
    As a consequence, from 2012 to 2014, I only took sporadic photos with my iPhone.
    In other words, it was time to "lose weight"; or rather improve the "pixel to weight" ratio ...
  </p>
  <p>
    Next to that, I thought it would be a good idea to try taking videos again. 
    However, I wanted to keep my options open.
    So, in a "spontaneous" moment, I sold my Canon gear and swapped to a Sony NEX VG30 video camera, and a NEX 5 photo camera. 
    These were much, much, lighter than my Canon gear, and could use the <i>same</i> lenses.
    This was a strategic choice, as I wasn't sure if I wanted to really switch to video, do both, or stick to photography.
  </p>
  <p>
    After editing my first videos, I realised that I wanted to stick to photography, so I decided to deepen my "relationship" with Sony's <a href="links/milc">mirrorless</a> ecosystem.
    This resulted in a gradual migration to Sony's <a href="links/full-frame">full-frame</a> A7R series, in terms of two A7R II bodies with associated lenses. 
    As Sony's <a href="links/full-frame">full-frame</a> bodies and lenses still had quite a bit of weight, albeit certainly less than my former Canon setup, I also kept an <a href="links/aps-c">APS-C</a> based A6500 "around" with assorted lenses, for when I really wanted to travel light.
  </p>
  <p>
    Starting in 2023, I found myself in a new situation. 
    Work had brought me to Vienna, while my private life continued to remain firmly, and happily, in Luxembourg. 
    As such, I had to "split" my camera gear across two locations: Vienna and Luxembourg. 
    This resulted in a further investment in the A6500 based <a href="links/aps-c">APS-C</a> system, in terms of some new lenses, and a second (2nd hand) A6500 body.
    At the same time, it triggered some deeper thinking about a camera system that would better suit my travels and commuting behaviour in the longer term.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Transitioning to FujiFilm's XF system</h3>
  <p>
    On one of my photo expeditions to Namibia, I noticed how some of my photography friends were using FujiFilm's <a href="links/aps-c">APS-C</a> based XF system.
    Their bodies, and lenses, were certainly lighter than my Sony <a href="links/full-frame">full-frame</a> system.
    However, at that stage, Sony still had the big advantage of having a higher resolution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Around 2020, when watching <a href="links/elia-locardi">Elia Locardi's</a> tutorials on <i>photographing the world</i>, I noticed how he had transitioned from Nikon to FujiFilm with arguments that resonated well with me. 
    Weight, and a more tactile user interface experience.
    Of course, a counter argument against FujiFilm was (and still remains to some extent) its autofocus (for moving objects) that (for now) remains lagging behind Sony's autofocus.
    Nevertheless, for those of us that focus on landscape and cityscape, this is less of a concern.
  </p>
  <p>
    Until 2024, I only kept a "passive" eye on the development of the FujiFilm cameras and lenses.
    Especially, since my Sony A6500 system, next to the A7R system, was catering to all my needs.
    As the lenses across the A6500 and A7R are basically exchangeable, albeit with some cropping effects, it provided me with a lot of flexibility.
    But ... then FujiFilm's X-T5 came along. 
    This camera has a higher resolution than the A6500, as well as the A7R II that I was using.
  </p>
  <p> 
    These developments resulted in some deep thinking, and admittedly, even some sleepless nights.
    Should I seriously consider moving to FujiFilm? 
    The new Sony A7CR would also provide me more resolution (megapixels) that I would actually need.
    So, why not switch to using the Sony A7CR as the main camera system? 
    Using the <a href="links/full-frame">full-frame</a> lenses it would outperform my aging A7R IIs in terms of resolution, and in crop-mode, such a body would even outperform my A6500's.  
  </p>
  <p> 
    However, eventually, I decided to go for the FujiFilm option. 
    Also after careful testing of one of the X-T5 bodies.
    The key reasons for finally making this move are:
    <ul>
      <li>
         <i>A tactile user interface -</i> 
         One of the arguments used by others in trading off FujiFilm and Sony is the fact that the FujiFilm X-T series (X-T1 and later) takes its design queues from vintage cameras, with physical dials to select aperture, ISO, exposure compensation, etc, as opposed to a more "computer like" user interface of the Sony cameras.
         Those people would say "do you want to handle a camera, or a computer".
         Now, I'm a computer scientist by trade, so I'm not really impressed by the "computer like" argument. 
         However, in the field, I do like to have a more <i>tactile</i> interaction with the camera, which is precisely what the "retro" dials of the X-T series offers.
         And, accidentally, it does take me back to memories of the times I was <a href="photography-history">dreaming</a> about a full fledged SLR system with different lenses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Grams per pixel ratio -</i>
        The X-T5 has, as an <a href="links/aps-c">APS-C</a> camera, a resolution of 40 megapixel, which is higher than my "old" Sony A7R II and A6500 would offer, and is certainly enough to allow for large prints!
        When I would have moved to one of the newer Sony cameras, the overall (i.e. lenses and bodies) "grams per pixel" ratio of these setups would be higher than for a FujiFilm X-T series based setup.
        The important thing, here, is that it effectively also means that carrying the FujiFilm equipment around (when travelling and hiking) is a lot easier than the Sony equipment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Euro per pixel ratio -</i>
        For the price of one Sony A7RC, and certainly for a Sony A7R IV, you can easily buy two FujiFilm X-T5's.
        Also, with the current prices on the 2nd hand market, one can make some good deals in migrating from Sony "glass" to FujiFilm XF "glass", with equal (red-label) performance. 
        Effectively, this means that FujiFilm's X-T series has a better "Euro per pixel" ratio than the Sony cameras have.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Unified user experience -</i>
        When mixing a Sony A7CR and Sony A7R IV based setup, I would still need to use two different user interfaces. 
        With a move to a FujiFilm X-T5 based setup, I can standardise on one (tactile) user interface.
        A hidden "gem" with regards to the latter is the X-T5's ability to sync settings between X-T5's using the associated iPhone App.
      </li>
    </ul>
    As a result, I'm now in the middle of migrating from Sony to FujiFilm.
    As a first step, I'm phasing out the Sony <a href="links/aps-c">APS-C</a> based A6500 system. 
    After that, I will soon be phasing out the Sony <a href="links/full-frame">full-frame</a> based A7R system.
