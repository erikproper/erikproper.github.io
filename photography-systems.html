  <h2>Camera systems</h2>
  <p>
    Over the years, I have used different camera systems, covering analog and digital, full-frame and APS, video and photography, as well as different brands.
    On this page, I discuss the evolution of the systems I used, as well as the reason for moving to another system.
    Some of these moves are tied to my <a href="./photography-history.html">troubled start</a> with photography, but also tied to the "pixel to weight" ratio of some of the camera systems.
  </p>
  
  <h3>The early analog years</h3>
  <p>
    I started out with a "hand-me-down" Agfa Isopan camera, which was later replaced by a Super 8 Film camera, which I believe was by Canon.
    Around 1989, when I got <a href="./photography-history.html">back</a> into photography  I started with a Ricoh compact camera.
    During my Australian years, around 1996, I complemented this with a Panasonic video camera, to be able to send videos of my "adventures" back home to my Family in the Netherlands.
  </p>
  
  <h3>From analog to digital</h3>
  <p>
    After returning to the Netherlands, I initially stayed with video.
    Around 1999, I started using a digital video camera (with tapes) by Canon.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an experiment, to see if I wanted to return to photography, I bought a Canon PowerShot A40.
    This was actually my first digital photo camera.
    As the photos I made with this camera turned out to be fairly good, my partner at the time, suggested me to use her Minolta SLR system during some work related trips to Uganda, which also resulted in a positive experience.
  </p>
    
  <h3>Transitioning to the Canon DSLR system</h3>
  <p>
    The positive experiences with both the Canon PowerShot A40 and the Minolta SLR system, inspired a transition to a Canon DSLR system.
    This is when, around 2004, I stopped with the video cameras, and switched to Canon's EF-S DSLR systems.
    First a 300D, which was later replaced by a 20D and 30D.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once I was certain that photography was "there to stay", I moved from Canon's APC based EF-S system to their full-frame systems, around 2006, 
    More specifically towards the 5D series, together with an upgrade of the lenses from EF-S to EF.
    The latter, eventually, also resulted in a rather heavy camera bag. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>Transitioning to Sony's mirrorless system</h3>
  <p>
    Early 2012, I found myself taking less and less photos.
    This was partially due to a busy work agenda, but also be
    I had just moved to Luxembourg to take up a challenging new job. 
    At the same time I was also getting "fed-up" with the need to have to luge my heavy camera bag around; I needed to "lose weight".
  </p>
  <p>
    As a consequence, from 2012 to 2014, I only took sporadic photos with my iPhone.
    Next to that, I thought it would be a good idea to try taking videos again. 
    However, I wanted to keep my options open.
    So, in a "spontaneous" moment, I sold my Canon gear and swapped to a Sony NEX VG30 video camera, and a NEX 5 photo camera. 
    These were much, much, lighter than my Canon gear, and could use the <i>same</i> lenses.
    This was a strategic choice, as I wasn't sure if I wanted to really switch to video, do both, or stick to photography.
  </p>
  <p>
    After editing my first videos, I realised that I wanted to stick to photography, so I decided continue my WHEN
    From NEX to FF Sony A7R series. 
    Weight played up ... so also A6500
    
    Later ... need for dual system for two locatons.
    
    But weight, and dual system (price)
  </p>
  
  <h3>Transitioning to Fujifilm XF System</h3>
  Weight
  Elia
  
  Analog feeling ... back to the old days (ref)
  Link back to old camera feedling .... dreaming of camera ...
  
  And ... newest XT-5 .... now in the middle of transitioning. 
  
  FujiFilm ... Elia ... etc.
