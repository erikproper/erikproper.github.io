  <h2>How I found my way (back) to photography</h2>
  <p>
    Quite often people ask me how I came to take up photography as a hobby. 
    Therefore, as an inspiration to potential fellow photographers, as well as parents and champions of future photographers, I thought it might be interesting to share the experiences I've had in finding my way (back) to photography. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Actually, "photography and me" had a bit of a troubled start.
    I took until the "digital age", before we really became intimate friends.
  </p>
  
  <h2>The years of disillusion</h2>
  <p>
    During my early teens, I vividly remember seeing photos in magazines, as well as the photos of some of my family members, and thinking ... I want to make such photos as well. 
    Next to that, I also had a natural interest in the technology of photography.
    I guess I was born with an engineering interest, so camera systems with interchangeable lenses and filters have always had a natural attraction to me.
    Back in those days I was also "studying" the photography related pages of the sales catalogue of a mail-order firm; well ... daydreaming I guess.
  </p>
  <p>
    Needless to say that in my early teens I did not have the financial resources to purchase an SLR (Single-Lens Reflex) camera and lenses myself.
    So, I started taking photos with a "hand-me-down" Agfa Isopan camera. 
    I vividly remember what it was like to take photos with the Agfa Isopan camera, and to then take the rolls of exposed film to the local photoshop to have them developed. 
    With ample anticipation I would then pick up the developed photos a few days later ...
  </p>
  <p>
    Regretfully, however, my anticipation was often converted into an utter disillusion.
    Photos were not sharp. 
    The lighting was off. 
    No concept of composition to speak of. 
    Et cetera. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Was it my lack of skills? 
    Well you have to start somewhere ... 
    Was it the fault of the ageing (hand-me-down) camera? 
    It might certainly have played a role.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, purchasing film, and having them developed, also resulted in a big dent in my pocket money, adding more pain to the disillusion when being confronted with the results. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Regretfully, there was no champion in my environment to stimulate, or even lead me the way, in developing my photography skills as an early teen. 
    As a result, I simply stopped taking photos.
  </p>
  <p>
    I certainly continued reading books on photography.
    However, the lack of a first positive experience, withheld me from investing more (pocket money) into exploring photography.
    I guess I also kept daydreaming.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my late teens, I had more pocket money. 
    Also since I delivered newspapers to earn some extra money.
    In these years, inspired by my father and brother, I tried Super 8 filming with another "hand-me-down" camera I got from my father.
    This also quickly devolved into another disillusion. 
    Both in terms of the consumption of (editing) time and financial resources, combined with a lack of coaching.
  </p>
  <p>
    As said, a rather troubled start ...
  </p>
  
  <h2>First positive experiences</h2>
  <p>
    As a young adult, while having a regular salary, I did get myself a compact camera to take basic photos during holidays.
    In using this camera, I even managed to make the occasional decent holiday shot. 
    It certainly allowed me to gradually improve my intuition regarding good compositions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless, the frustration from my past disillusion prevented me from "moving up".
    Both in terms of actively engaging in discussions about photos, as well as improving on my photography gear. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Due to my move to Australia in 1994, I bought a video camera to keep my family back home up-to-date about my adventures in this "far away" country. 
    Using the video camera actually allowed me to improve my feeling about compositions, and possibly even improve some skills in this regard. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Later, after returning to the Netherlands in 1997, I moved up to a digital video camera, and further developed my feeling, and understanding, for compositions.
  </p>
  
  <h2>The switch to photography</h2>
  <p>
    Around 2002, four developments joined forces that resulted in me finding my (back) way to photography.
  </p>
  <p>  
    Firstly, I was increasingly getting "fed-up" with editing videos. 
    Rather than spending hours editing video locked up in a room inside, I preferred being out there taking new footage.
    At the start, editing was done using two video recorders.
    Later, the onset of the digital age allowed me to use a computer.
    This brought some improvement, but as the capacity of computers around the turn of the century was still limited, the whole process was rather time consuming, while the software and computer used also had a (crashing) mind of their own.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, as a result of using a video camera, I got more actively and deeply interested in the photographic challenge of capturing four dimensions (3d + time) in a two dimensional plane. 
    In a way, one can argue that a video camera is a "brute force" tool when compared to a photo camera, when it is about capturing these four dimensions.
    However, when using a photo camera, one really has to think about how to capture the dynamics of the subject one is photographing in a static image. 
    More challenging, in a creative sense, I would say. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, due to my rationality-driven work in research and consultancy, my inner soul started to cry out for a more feeling-oriented activity. 
    When taking photos, I initially operate quite intuitively, using my feelings. 
    I will then, of course, rationally look at ways to optimise the composition, the exposure, etc. 
    But it starts with a feeling.
    As such, I've learned that when I "enter" a new environment with my camera, I first need to "sync" myself with the environment, before I can become creative.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Fourthly, given my profession in the field of IT, the onset of digital photography had a natural attraction to me. 
    It also enabled a re-entry into photography in a (cost) controlled way. 
    No more wasting of money on films ... 
    Furthermore, digital photography brought the advantage of direct feedback.
  </p>
  <p>
    Early 2002 I therefore purchased a digital Canon PowerShot A40. 
    While taking photos, I was able to experiment with compositions and exposure,and in doing so improve my skills and style.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Getting serious about photography</h2>
  <p>
    In the summer of 2002, I was lucky enough to "have" to pay a working visit to Uganda.
    My partner, who had witnessed both my rekindled interest in photography, as well as the emerging ability to take decent photos, had an (analog) Minolta SLR with a set of interchangeable lenses. 
    She advised me to take them with me on the working visit to Uganda. 
    During this work visit, I also managed to visit some of the nature reserves. 
    This resulted in quite a few decent <a href="https://www.erikproper.eu/collections/landscapes/africa/uganda/2002">photos</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This positive "Uganda experience" led me to taking photography serious again.
    Possibly due to my Calvinistic Dutch heritage, but certainly based on echos from my past desillusions, I decided to "go slowly" in terms of purchasing actual photography 
      <a href="./photography-gear.html">gear</a>.
    I first wanted to make sure if I would really like photography and stick to it, before investing heavily into better
      <a href="./photography-gear.html">gear</a>. 
    Therefore, I continued using the digital Canon PowerShot A40 to improve my skills and experience, while using the analog Minolta from my partner for situations requiring better photography gear.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Deepening the experience</h2>
  <p>
    By 2004, DSLRs had become affordable.
    This is when I switched to a Canon 300D with some basic lenses, which I happily used on a trip to Suriname, as well as further work visits to Australia and Uganda.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2006, I decided to take things to a higher level. 
    I therefore attended a series workshop on nature and landscape photography, organised by <a href="https://www.erikproper.eu/links/geurt-besselink">Geurt Besselink</a>.
    This workshop got me "hooked", while it (and follow up workshops and photo expeditions) allowed m	e to hone my skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    Step by step I migrated from the Canon 300D via a 20D and 30D to a 5D and a 5D II full-frame camera with assorted (white) lenses. During several photo expeditions, I was able to also further develop my skills while gaining insights, and inspiration, from
      <a href="https://www.erikproper.eu/links/geurt-besselink">Geurt Besselink</a>
    and 
      <a href="https://www.erikproper.eu/links/peter-cox">Peter Cox</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Losing focus in losing weight</h2>
  <p>
    Early 2012, I found myself taking less and less photos. 
    This was partially due to a busy work agenda. 
    I had just moved to Luxembourg to take up a challenging new job. 
    At the same time I was also getting "fed up" with the need to lug my heavy camera bag around; I needed to "lose weight".
  </p>
  <p>
    As a consequence, from 2012 to 2014, I only took sporadic photos with my iPhone.
    Next to that, I thought it would be a good idea to try taking videos again. 
    So, in a "spontaneous" moment, I sold my Canon gear and swapped to a Sony NEX VG30 video camera, and a NEX 5 photo camera. 
    These were much, much, lighter than my Canon gear.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this excursion into videography, once again, proved to be a bad move. 
    Editing videos would still consume too much time. 
    Time that I would rather spend in the field taking photos, or on my bike staying fit.
  </p>
  <p>
    After observing myself getting "stuck" with video editing, I decided to switch back to photography again. 
    And yes ... in the process losing quite a bit of weight in the financial sense as well.
    At the same time, it taught m	e more about my own focus and preferences.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Back to photography</h2>
  <p>
    Realising that my real passion is in taking photos, and not video, in late 2014 I finally decided to go "get back" into photography. 
    Based on my experiences with the NEX based photo camera, and its low weight, I decided to switch to a Sony based, <a href="links/milc ">mirrorless</a> (full-frame) system. 
    The (potential!) advantage of a <a href="links/milc ">mirrorless</a> system is the reduced weight of the gear.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Keeping competition out of it</h2>
  <p>
    I have a competitive nature. 
    When cycling, I like to be up front. 
    However, with photography, I like to be able to work from my feelings. 
    Not rationality driven. 
    Not competition driven. 
    But, feeling driven.
  </p>
  <p>
    The latter is also the reason why I prefer not to participate in photo competitions. 
    I do not want to find myself in the field thinking if the photo I am about to take would be a potential winner in some competition. 
    That thought would distract me from what I'm actually out there for ... taking photos that feel well, while enjoying the outdoors.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Continued inspiration</h2>
  <p>
    Next to being inspired by photos in magazines on travel, nature and photography, I also find inspiration in the work by other photographers. 
    In the past, I have already been inspired by 
      <a href="https://www.erikproper.eu/links/geurt-besselink">Geurt Besselink</a>
    and 
      <a href="https://www.erikproper.eu/links/peter-cox">Peter Cox</a>.
    on landscape photography, while
      <a href="https://www.erikproper.eu/links/chase-jarvis">Chase Jarvis</a>
    inspired me in seeing that the best camera is simply the one you have with you. 
    More recently, I've also found the work by 
      <a href="https://www.erikproper.eu/links/elia-locardi">Elia Locardi</a> 
    highly inspiring, in particular his tutorials. 
  </p>
  
  <h2>A final word about weight</h2>
  <p>
    My issues with the weight of my Canon gear brought me to the Sony <a href="links/milc ">mirrorless</a> system.
    As mentioned, the potential advantage of a <a href="links/milc ">mirrorless</a> system is the reduced weight of the gear.
    However, over the past years, I've seen the weight of my Sony (full-frame) gear increase as well.
    As I discuss in more detail on a dedicated
      <a href="./photography-systems">page</a>
    this, combined with the increase in resolution of APS-C cameras, now brings me to a next change of camera system, towards Fuji.
