  annote	= {In this paper, we elaborate on the Enterprise Architecture (EA) and how it can be improved by using Enterprise Interoperability (EI) requirements. We describe how enterprise
		  interoperability is related to EA concepts by especially analysing the definition and the foundation of interoperability, highlighting the relationships with EA. We then propose a
		  conceptual model that defines the enterprise architecture interoperability domain. In doing so, conceptual descriptions of systems, interoperability problems and solutions are
		  identified. The designed model can be inferred for decision-aid related to interoperability. Finally, we illustrate our approach by means of a case in the automotive industry.},
